## Ch.2 Meaningful Names

### Takeaways
- Well named things should be self-explanatory.
- Avoid Disinformation.
- Distinguish names in such a way that the reader knows what the differences offer.
- Use Pronounceable Names.
- Use Searchable Names.
- Professional understands that clarity is king. Professionals use their powers for good and write code that others can understand.

### Thoughts
- Itâ€™s probably better not to encode the container type into the name -> I have tendency to name my variables such as `accountArr`, but this is very interesting. With the help of `Interface` and `types`, my naming can be improved.
- Clarity is king, period.
- Using searchable names is a very interesting technique as I definitely do come across times to search for a partial variable name such as `requiredDays` - and I sometimes extend variable names such as `requiredDaysForGroup` and `daysForMonth`... I can be more specific on naming likely variables for easier searching.
- Nice chapter on revisiting simple rules that can be instantly applied to daily work.
