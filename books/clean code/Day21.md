# *Clean Code* by *Robert Cecil Martin*

## DAY 21 - 10/Feb/2022
## Ch.10 Classes

### Takeaways
- Organize classes to reduce the risk of change.
> We want to structure our systems so that we muck with as little as possible when we update them with new or changed features.

> In an ideal system, we incorporate new features by extending the system, not by making modifications to existing code.

- DIP says that our classes should depend upon abstractions, not on concrete details.

### Thoughts
- It's been a while since the last time I used the term 'Dependency Inversion Principle' - one of the most important pillars of OOP. It's great to revisit some important concepts of OOP.
- I've seen more `Interface` in React projects these days, thanks to TypeScript. Although the usage of it may be limited but the fact that we crate an interface in TypeScript can be interpreted as a language involving to bulletproof its weakness.
- Rather a short chapter to be read over two days, but the information it entails required a reasonable amount of time to regurgitate. A strong and solid understanding is required here - abstraction, encapsulation, private methods and Dependency Inversion - I think I just covered the basics of JAVA... LOL!
