# *Clean Code* by *Robert Cecil Martin*

## DAY 01 - 21/Jan/2022

### Takeaways
- It is through practice in the small that professionals gain proficiency and trust for practice in the large.
- The smallest bit of sloppy construction, of the door that does not close tightly or the slightly crooked tile on the floor, or even the messy desk, completely dispels the charm of the larger whole.
- It's about being honest to the code, honest to our colleagues about the state of our code and, most of all, being honest with ourselves about our code.

- Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those decisions the wrong way.

### Thoughts
- From the day 1 of my very first bootcamp back in 2016, til the last week's daily standup - writing clean code has been the priority. Well, has it really? I have made many, one too many compromises just to 'get through the day', and/or neglect the giant spaghetti code that I knew for sure it needed to be refactored but did not lie my fingers on - 'it's more than I can chew' or 'I did not write this'. It's a good time to accept the reality and be honest that I haven't been writing 'cleaner' code than I should've otherwise.
- I really like how coding is compared to craftsmanship. A Tesla may still be extremely popular, but haven't heard a good thing about being near perfect. Cosmetic issues, little pieces are simply missing and customers do not feel so proud of throwing $$$. What kind of developer do I project myself to be in 5, or 10 years? A great looking car, or a truly great car?

### Extra
- I'm glad I have started reading this book - let's do this!
