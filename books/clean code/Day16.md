# *Clean Code* by *Robert Cecil Martin*

## DAY 16 - 05/Feb/2022
## Sharing best TILs from other readers

### Best TILs
- [Alison](https://aliyooncreative.notion.site/TIL-2022-01-27-cf6946a54bff4f64b973597ef1680118)
> As Alison is the only other reader who reads/journals in English, I often visit her TILs for a better understanding + hunting for something that is missing in my TIL. In general, really like how Alison leaves her personal thoughts on the reads, not just quotes or 5-word summarized sentences.
- [Arthur Coker](https://antstudy.tistory.com/365?category=912675)
> Arthur's this specific TIL on refactoring his/her own code was really pleasant to see, and felt very authentic. I should've included a piece of code from my work/project and acutally worked on it. Oh well, another side project to do - refator all my spaghetti github repos!

### Thoughts
- I've read through about 20~30 TILs and it was really nice to see there are so many other deves/future devs thriving to learn and are dedicated for daily reading/studies. It really feels good - and it'll be even better if there is a chance to get to connect with them.
- It's really hillarious how every individual has different approach in journaling. Different platforms, different writing, different thoughts... and in the end, I believe `CLEAN CODE` can bring us all and unite us all for better maintainability and readability. Remember - my goal is to make the new dev who'll be picking up from where I left feel like he/she is at home.
- Another great day of extra-curricular exercise along with quiz missions. I still would like to have a related blog/youtube for interesting things!
