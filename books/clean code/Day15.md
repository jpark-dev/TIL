# *Clean Code* by *Robert Cecil Martin*

## DAY 15 - 04/Feb/2022
## Recap on last 2 weeks

### Accomplishments
- Daily effort reading a book and writing my reflections - definitely a good habit of learning new things + journaling.
- I alrady feel that I have learend a lot about writing cleaner code.
- I was picked as one of the refactoring mission - that felt so good!

### Future Improvements
- More aggressive use of codeblocks, use real-life examples as well as watch/read related youtubes/blogs.
- Read TILs from other TIL participants and make a good 3-point summary.
- Maybe proceed the TIL a day ahead instead of a day behind - the time difference between PST vs. KST gives -17hrs. Wouldn't hurt to do the daily read a day ahead for sure!
- Summarize/edit TILs of the week at the end of the week.
