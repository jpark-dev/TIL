# *Clean Code* by *Robert Cecil Martin*

## DAY 09 - 28/Jan/2022
## Ch.4 Comments

### Takeaways
- If there is a need to write a comment, make it clear and consise.
- No redundant comments.
- No misleading comments.
- No noisy (meaningless) comments.
- No closing brace comments `// while` or `// catch` - refactor into smaller functions.
- No HTML comments.
- No distant comments - should be right next to what it decribes.
- No TMI (historical discussions and irrelevant descriptions).
- No comments requiring further explanation.
- 
##### Thanks to the version control such as Git:
- No Journal comments - no longer needed.
- No Attributions/bylines - no longer needed.
- No commented codes - discourages others to delete it.

### Thoughts
- After reading all these little sub-topics about bad comments, spending more time for a better naming makes even more sense. A good name should speaks for itself.
- It's interesting where the attributions and somewhat considered as TMIs have been the norm in my first year as Java developer: even when the team was using a version control like SVN. It's interesting to see how things have changed, and will change in the future.
- I actually revisited some of the codes I've written in the past and I'm more of the guy who wants to leave TMI comments - when it comes down to the techinicality. I really should avoid it, or maybe make the comments shorter with a link to a wiki or something.
