### Thoughts
- Great summary of what it means to be pragmatic.
- The stone soup story is clearly from somewhere else, I've heard many different versions. Even though it was pretty cheesy (could've just used the original story!), the takeaway is great here - show them you are on the right track!
- Really love the knowledge portfolio suggestions. I'm currently doing:
  - Read a technical book every quarter
  - Take classes
  - Participate in local user groups
  - Use Mac/Linux/Windows.
  - Watch youtube channels related to latest tech/langauges.
  - Hey, I'm not doing too bad at this!!!
- Chapter 1 was pretty long to be honest, but it has a lot of profund knowledges. I strongly recommend this chapter, particularly for those who just became developers without work experience from other industries.
- My first 100 - liner TIL. It became more of a summary of the chapter, but I like it as I'm going to make a good use of this TIL. I'll come back many times for sure!
