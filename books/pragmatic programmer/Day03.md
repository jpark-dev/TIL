  - There can be conincidental duplications in code - same code but different purpose they serve.
  - The code can itself explains - keep the code DRY by removing unncessary comments!

  - Bring similar internal APIs.
  - Publich public API if doesn't exist.
  - Use KV pair over fixed structures(i.e. class)
  - Active and frequent communication b/w developers help!!
    - Daily scrum, standup, slack channel... etc.
    - Appoint members with their roles: project librarian
