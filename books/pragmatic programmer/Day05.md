## DAY 05 - 21/Mar/2022
## Choose 3 best TILs from other bookclub members.

- Due to the nature of the last 3 days of reading - there are more dot points and a lot of concepts that need time to understand and utilize them. I read a dozen TILs and picked the ones looked great.
- I know this is a good 3-week read, but it is really fast paced. Should really break this into half.
- The technical terms and coder-jargons are getting cheesy translated in Korean - just like other techinical books. Just saying... *goosebumps*


### 1 - wolfye
- I like the idea of leaving the page number for each dot point: this will be extremely useful.
- A lot of TILs for the last 2 assignments are really similar in contents and their dot point structures, but I still liked wolfye's self reflecetions.

### 2 - nlom0218
- Red colored font does stand out in paragraphs of TILs.
- A lot more concise than others'.

### 3 - girlwldud
- Concise and straight to the important points what I thought to be.
- Maybe I should make my TIL way shorter...
